# Bank_Stocks_Project
**Overview**
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the stock performance of four of the largest U.S. banks: Bank of America (BAC), Citibank (Citi), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC), spanning from 2022 to 2023. The project involves visualizing stock trends, calculating key performance statistics, and analyzing the volatility and percentage changes in stock prices for each bank.

**Key Features**:
Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Handled stock price data, parsed dates, and structured the dataset for analysis.
Stock Trend Visualization: Interactive and static visualizations showing the daily stock prices for each bank.
Average Stock Prices: Calculated and visualized the average stock prices over time.
Summary Statistics: Computed key metrics like mean, median, standard deviation, and percentage change to compare stock performance.
Visual Insights: Graphs that compare stock volatility and percentage change over time, providing insights into each bank's performance.
Technologies Used:
R: For data analysis and visualization.
ggplot2: To create static visualizations.
Plotly: For interactive plots.
tidyverse: For data manipulation.
gridExtra: For arranging multiple plots in a grid layout.

**Visuals**
This project includes several key visualizations:
Stock Price Trends: Line charts comparing the stock performance of all four banks.
Average Stock Prices: Overlay of average stock prices on individual stock trends.
Summary Statistics: Bar charts visualizing mean prices, volatility, and percentage changes across the banks.
Key Insights
JPMorgan Chase exhibited the highest mean stock price over the analysis period, with relatively low volatility.
Citibank had the smallest percentage change in stock price, while Bank of America showed the most volatility.
The calculated average stock prices provided a general overview of how these banks performed relative to each other.

**Future Work**
Extend the analysis to include other financial metrics such as P/E ratios or dividends.
Compare bank performance during different economic conditions (e.g., before and after interest rate hikes).
Build a forecasting model to predict future stock prices.
